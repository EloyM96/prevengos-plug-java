# Frontend Scaffold

This directory will host the Next.js application for the Prevengos Plug MVP UI.

## Getting Started
1. Initialise a Next.js project with `npx create-next-app@latest .`.
2. Configure API client utilities to consume the FastAPI backend JSON contracts.
3. Use shared design guidelines to keep user flows consistent with the MVP scope.
